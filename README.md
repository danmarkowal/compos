# COMPOS Proxy

This is a tool that allows you to access the awesome and **publicly available** [COMPOS](https://compos.web.ox.ac.uk/assignments) assignments that, for some odd reason, are hidden from the main website but can still be accessed freely via changing the URL in your browser.

This tool simply works by scanning the URLs of possible assignments (which follow a predictable naming convention) and redirecting the user to any selected assignemnt PDF.

**I DO NOT OWN AND DID NOT CREATE, NOR AM I DISTRIBUTING ANY OF THESE ASSIGNMENTS AS THERE IS NO FUNDAMENTAL RESTRICTION APPLIED TO ACCESSING THEM VIA URL**
